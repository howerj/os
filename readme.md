Attempts at a new operating system and programming language.

This is a work in progress/collection of documents.

## To Do

* [x] Add resources to a document folder for easy access to all things
  operating system related, add git repositories if possible, for a
  complete history.
* [ ] Implement a RISC-V 64 bit core, with an MMU
* [ ] Implement a cross compiler for a Pascal/Oberon variant
* [ ] Implement bootstrapping tools
* [ ] Create a toy kernel
* [ ] Expand into a Unix kernel
* [ ] Develop user-land
  - [ ] Make a TCL like shell
  - [ ] Busybox equivalent
  - [ ] Compiler for Pascal/Oberon variant
* [ ] Turn system into self-hosting one
* [ ] Remove cross compiler and bootstrapping tools
* [ ] Remove documentation
* [ ] Create project documentation
