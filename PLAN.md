# PLAN.md

The eventual plan will be to create a plan 9 / Unix v7 clone with a lisp
oriented user land. Although that is the long term.

The short term I plan on getting a better VGA text driver up and running,
keyboard and floppy disk. Once that is done a small FORTH interpreter will
be made as a sort of kernel shell and debugging interface before proceeding
with the rest of the system.
